# Assignment 8

1. Playing with TTS:

One way to make a conversation livelier, express personality and emotion, is to vary the voice. In this homework you will experiment with various characteristics of the voice synthesis.

- [x] 1.1 Watch [this introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzL-pxcpo-E) to Text-to-Speech technology

- [x] 1.2 Play with varying voice parameters [using this example](http://codepen.io/matt-west/full/wGzuJ)

You can [read the details about this example and TTS API in general here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-started-speech-synthesis-api) 

- [x] 1.3 Examine the attached verbal.js. The modifications I made are between lines 77 and 107. Update your latest chatbot (HW6) with this chunk of code.

- [x] 1.4 Run your chatbot from HW6 with various values for the following parameters:

      u.volume = 0.5 //between 0.1
      u.pitch = 2.0 //between 0 and 2
      u.rate = 1.0 //between 0.1 and 5-ish
      u.voice = speechSynthesis.getVoices().filter(function(voice) { return voice.name == "Karen"; })[0]; //pick a voice

*To see the possible values of voices, in addition to "Karen", run your script with the debug console open.
*Pick the values of the parameters that you like the best with your conversational agent's character.

- [x] 1.5 Upload the new version of your embodied conversational agent to a directory hw8 of your github. Include the link in your homework submission in Google Classroom.

- [x] 2. The project teams that have not presented your progress update will present next Monday, April 3rd.
