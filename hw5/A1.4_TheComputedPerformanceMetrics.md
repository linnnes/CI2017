# Q 1.4 

Compute TP, FP, FN, TN, Recall and Precision measures for your chatbot. If your corpus is rich enough, both FP and FN should be non-zero. If they are zero, enrich your corpus with more complex examples to make it more realistic.

# A 1.4

- True Positive (TP) = 10
- False Positive (FP) = 0
- False Negative (FN) = 3
- True Negative (TN) = 7
- Accuracy (ACC) = (TP+TN) / All = 17 / 20 = 85%
- Precision (P) = TP / (TP + FP) = 10 / (10 + 0) = 100%
- Recall (R) = TP / (TP + FN) = 10 / (10 + 3) â‰’ 0.77%

Analysis: 

FP is zero. And it means the corpuses should be more various in order to get more realistic data.
