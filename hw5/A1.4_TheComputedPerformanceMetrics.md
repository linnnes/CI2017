# Q 1.4 

Compute TP, FP, FN, TN, Recall and Precision measures for your chatbot. If your corpus is rich enough, both FP and FN should be non-zero. If they are zero, enrich your corpus with more complex examples to make it more realistic.

# A 1.4

- True Positive = 10
- False Positive = 0
- False Negative = 3
- True Negative = 7

Analysis: FP is zero. And it means the corpuses should be more various in order to get more realistic data.
