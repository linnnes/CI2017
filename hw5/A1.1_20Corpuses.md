# Q 1.1

>Come up with a balanced corpus of at least 20 utterances.
>The corpus is balanced if half of it is in-domain, and half is out-of-domain. Make sure the corpus is rich enough, namely, it's not too trivial to come up with rules that separate in-domain from out-of-domain. Any corpus that is representative enough of real conversation will be rich.
