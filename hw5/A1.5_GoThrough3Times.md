# Q 1.5

Go through this cycle 3 times. In the end you will have a corpus and 3 different instances of each:

FSM+code, Table of performance of the chatbot on the corpus, and the performance metrics (TP, FP, FN, TN, Recall, Precision)


# A 1.5

## Test 1

1.1. [FSM](#) + [Code](#)

1.2. Chatbot Performance

- Chatbot performance (Predicted Condition): C.P.
- Ground Truth (Condition): G.T.



C.P.| G.T.|    Utterance     |
----|-----|------------------|
+|+| Search SF   |
+|+| Search San Francisco in California   |
+|+| Let's do San Francisco        |
+|+| Look up San Fran   |
+|+| What's around San Francisco  |
+|+| San Francisco and Palo Alto   |
+|+| I want to know about San Francisco         |
+|+| Search Mission in San Francisco   |
+|+| Tell me about San Francisco   |
+|+| Show me San Francisco        |
+|-| Here   |
-|-| Search California    |
-|-| Can you show me here  |
-|-| Search Thai food   |
-|-| Show me Coffee Shop        |
-|-| Give me only the first result   |
+|-| Where is the best coffee shop   |
+|-| Search Noe Valley         |
-|-| Search Cortland Ave   |
-|-| Which one do you like         |


1.3. Performance Metrics:

- `True Positive (TP)` = 
- `False Positive (FP)` = 
- `False Negative (FN)` = 
- `True Negative (TN)` = 
- `Accuracy (ACC) = (TP+TN) / All` = 
- `Precision (P) = TP / (TP + FP)` = 
- `Recall (R) = TP / (TP + FN)` = 

- Conclusion: 



## Test 2

1.1. [FSM](#) + [Code](#)

1.2. Chatbot Performance

- Chatbot performance (Predicted Condition): C.P.
- Ground Truth (Condition): G.T.
