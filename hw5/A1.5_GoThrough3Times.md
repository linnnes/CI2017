# Q 1.5

Go through this cycle 3 times. In the end you will have a corpus and 3 different instances of each:

FSM+code, Table of performance of the chatbot on the corpus, and the performance metrics (TP, FP, FN, TN, Recall, Precision)


# A 1.5

## Test 1

1.1. [FSM](#) + [Code](#)

1.2. Chatbot Performance

- Chatbot performance (Predicted Condition): C.P.
- Ground Truth (Condition): G.T.



C.P.| G.T.|    Utterance     |
----|-----|------------------|
-|+| What's new in the city   |
+|+| Search San Francisco in California   |
+|+| Let's do San Francisco        |
+|+| Look up San Fran   |
+|+| What's around San Francisco  |
+|+| San Francisco and Seattle   |
+|+| I want to know about San Francisco         |
+|+| Search Mission in San Francisco   |
-|+| Tell me about here   |
-|+| Show me here        |
+|-| Here   |
-|-| Search California    |
-|-| play My Heart Left in San Francisco  |
-|-| Search Thai food   |
-|-| Show me Coffee Shop        |
-|-| Give me only the first result   |
+|-| Where is the best coffee shop   |
+|-| Search Noe Valley         |
-|-| Search Cortland Ave   |
-|-| Which one do you like         |


1.3. Performance Metrics:

- `True Positive (TP)` = 7
- `False Positive (FP)` = 3
- `False Negative (FN)` = 3
- `True Negative (TN)` = 7
- `Accuracy (ACC) = (TP+TN) / All` = (7+7) / 20 = 70%
- `Precision (P) = TP / (TP + FP)` = 7 / (7+3) = 70%
- `Recall (R) = TP / (TP + FN)` = 7 / (7+3) = 70%

- Conclusion: FP and FN both are non-zero now. Let's try more corpuses.



## Test 2

1.1. [FSM](#) + [Code](#)

1.2. Chatbot Performance

- Chatbot performance (Predicted Condition): C.P.
- Ground Truth (Condition): G.T.

+|-| San Francisco is very far         |


1.3. Performance Metrics:

- `True Positive (TP)` = 10
- `False Positive (FP)` = 5
- `False Negative (FN)` = 6
- `True Negative (TN)` = 9
- `Accuracy (ACC) = (TP+TN) / All` = (10+9) / 30 = 63%
- `Precision (P) = TP / (TP + FP)` = 10 / (10+5) = 66%
- `Recall (R) = TP / (TP + FN)` = 10 / (10+6) = 62.5%

- Conclusion: Improving the FSM and code and see if we can get the higher Recall rate.




## Test 3

1.1. [FSM](#) + [Code](#)

1.2. Chatbot Performance

- Chatbot performance (Predicted Condition): C.P.
- Ground Truth (Condition): G.T.

1.3. Performance Metrics:

- `True Positive (TP)` = 12
- `False Positive (FP)` = 3
- `False Negative (FN)` = 6
- `True Negative (TN)` = 9
- `Accuracy (ACC) = (TP+TN) / All` = (12+9) / 30 = 70%
- `Precision (P) = TP / (TP + FP)` = 12 / (12+3) = 80%
- `Recall (R) = TP / (TP + FN)` = 12 / (12+6) = 66%

- Conclusion: The precision is improved. The recall rate is slightly improved. The next improvement for the chatbot should be to discern the negative condition more accurately.
