### Cactus the SF Guide Bot

#### Instruction: Web-based chat-bot

We will put all the chatbots online for outsiders to see (and possibly score). Please update your best bot with the following:

- [x] Make your bot introduce itself. A user must be able to figure out what to say without looking at your source code. Do some user testing to see that users not familiar with your bot can actually figure out how to talk to it. You can use Recall and Precision measures to evaluate the success of your bot's performance.

- [User Testing Questionnaire](#)

- [User Testing Result](#)
	
- [x] Give your bot a name in the README.md file.
	
- [x] Optional: Render your name somewhere in the Window
	
- [x] Upload all source files/images to github and send me a link.
