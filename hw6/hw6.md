### 1. Conversational embodied character

We are moving towards studying nonverbal behaviors. The example code for the conversational embodied character that we will be working with is located at [here (*url updated)](https://github.com/maxipesfix/coversational_interfaces_spring_2017/tree/master/embodied). 
Clone the repository or copy the contents of the "embodied" directory to your computer. Study the code:

- verbal.js
	- you contains the familiar code that performs speech recognition and finite state machine-based dialogue.

- nonverbal.js
	- contains the code that animates the character.

You can find more about the way the animated character is built by reading [its creator's tutorial](http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-game-character/1/).



#### To help you understand the code:


- [x] 1. Replace the graphics with your own. Make your own animated character and give it a name.

- [x] 2. Find where in verbal.js the following behaviors are called:
 	- jump
	- breath rate increase/decrease
	- blink rate increase/decrease

	*Hint: Look for the comments saying "Nonverbal..."

	And find in nonverbal.js the implementation of:

	- jump
	- breath rate increase/decrease
	- blink rate increase/decrease
	- eye color setting

- [x] 3. Edit the behaviors in verbal.js and nonverbal.js so that the eyes of the character are RED with the character is listening.

- [ ] 4. Add your latest task or non-task oriented chatbot code from the previous homework into verbal.js. Make sure it works with the animated character.

- [ ] 5. Submit your work to your own directory on github, called hw6. (P.S. Add a screenshot of your embodied character to the hw6 directory at your github.)



### 2. Team assignment: 

Prepare a demo of your project work so far to be presented next Monday. The demo should ideally include a prototype that works: it can be a very small piece of your final product, but it should do something.
